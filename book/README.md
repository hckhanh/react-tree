# react-tree-es6

[jsTree](https://www.jstree.com) is written on library, my wrapper just *wrap it* to make sure it can work well with life cycle of React.
All APIs from jsTree are apply to this wrapper. So you can work with this component like [jsTree](https://www.jstree.com).

For now, it' just has some basic features. If you think there are some better ideas can apply to this wrapper,
please [make a issue](https://github.com/hckhanh/react-tree-es6/issues/new). *Any help would be appreciated.*
